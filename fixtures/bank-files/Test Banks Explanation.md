# Our 3 test banks (explained)

## Bank A
* Lets you download a CSV of your transactions per account
* The CSV then includes:
  * The bank's name
  * The date it was exported
  * The id of your account with them
  * A header explaining the columns
* A CSV file you downloaded last week is still lying around in your old-downloads folder
  * This file has been previously converted and uploaded to YNAB, but wasn't deleted
  * (This shouldn't matter if uploads to YNAB are idempotent!)
* Bank A has good apps and decent customer support
* The cool kid you knew back in high school uses them

## Bank B
* Let's you export your transactions to a CSV containing
  * No header row
  * The bank's name
  * The name id of your account with them
* Bank B's apps and support are not stellar, but they have good rates

## Bank C
* Does not have unique filenames, just 'export.csv'
* In order to indicate which file belongs to which account, the user has
  to organize the files into a folder structure themselves
* Their apps suck. It's probably the same bank your grandma has been using for decades
